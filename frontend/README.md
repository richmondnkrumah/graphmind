## 📝 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Home Page (`HomePage.tsx`):**
   - Welcome screen with project info and navigation.

2. **Upload Page (`UploadPage.tsx`):**
   - Drag-and-drop or select up to 3 documents (PDF, TXT, DOCX).
   - Shows upload progress and status.
   - Sends files to backend `/upload` endpoint.

3. **Graph Viewer Page (`GraphViewerPage.tsx`):**
   - Displays interactive knowledge graph for the selected document.
   - Shows entities (nodes) and relationships (edges).
   - Lets you switch between uploaded documents.

4. **Reusable UI Components (`components/ui/`):**
   - **button.tsx:** Consistent buttons for actions.
   - **card.tsx:** Card layouts for document previews.
   - **progress.tsx:** Progress bars for uploads and processing.
   - **sonner.tsx:** Toast notifications for feedback.

5. **Layout (`components/Layout.tsx`):**
   - Handles page structure, navigation, and responsiveness.

6. **Utilities (`lib/utils.ts`):**
   - Helper functions for formatting, API calls, etc.
